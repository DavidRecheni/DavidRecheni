I started to code 15 years ago and I'm still eager to learn new tech and improve my skills.  I feel comfortable accepting responsibilities and coordinating teams. Due to my studies as Designer and Dev, and my long experience working as freelancer, I can ideate, design, develop and deploy solutions from scratch. Iâ€™ve worked as Full-stack developer most of my carreer but I decided to specialize in Frontend and I've been Full-time Front-end for 3yrs.
